sed 's/<word to replace>/<Replacing Word>/g' <file>

sed -i   will commit the changes to the file

Can chain with ;   for example:
sed 's/<word to replace>/<Replacing Word>/g;s/<word to replace>/<Replacing Word>/g' <file>


Replace first word with nothing:
sed 's/\w*//' file

sed 's/\w*$//' file

Only show letters and numbers, remove rest:
sed 's/[^[:alnum:]]\+//g' 

Only show punctuation, remove rest:
sed 's/[^[:punct:]]\+//g' 

Delete the last letter in every line:
cat DNS | sed 's/.$//' 


Formatting

Every word into new line:
sed -i s/\\s/\\n/g filename.txt

Make every word on a new line, and then delete extra lines between words:
cat AllUsers.txt | tr ' ' '\n' >> AllUsersMod.txt &&  sed -i '/^$/d' AllUsersMod.txt
