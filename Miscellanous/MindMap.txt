	Internal Network Pentesting
		Windows Domains
		Linux Domains
		Mixed

	External Network Pentesting
		


Internal Network Pentesting
---------------------------    
	First steps:
		1. Identify where you are on the network 
			Command prompt > ifconfig/ipconfig
	
		2. What other hosts are on your subnet? What other hosts can you reach?
			Network scanning tools such as nmap
				nmap -F -vv -T4 192.168.0.0/24 




  

External Network Pentesting
---------------------------   
	1. Discover the perimeter
		Using third party sites such as

			Shodan

    Reconniscance:
        1. Nmap all 65535 ports, running -sV -sC -vv -p0-
