With a few basic commands (there's a TON more), we can start to learn a lot about a machine:

    What's the OS? What version? What architecture?
        cat /etc/*-release
        uname -i
        lsb_release -a (Debian based OSs)

    Who are we? Where are we?
        ?id
        pwd

    Who uses the box? What users? (And which ones have a valid shell)
        cat /etc/passwd
        grep -vE "nologin|false" /etc/passwd

    What's currently running on the box? What active network services are there?
        ps aux
        netstat -antup

See what's installed on the machine:
anything that has been manually installed/compiled will NOT show up here (might want to check "/var/", "/opt/", "/usr/local/src" and "/usr/src/" for common places. Examine EVERYTHING  
  What's installed? What kernel is being used?
        dpkg -l (Debian based OSs)
        rpm -qa (CentOS / openSUSE )
	ls -alh /usr/bin/
	ls -alh /sbin/
	ls -alh /var/cache/apt/archivesO
	ls -alh /var/cache/yum/
        uname -a
