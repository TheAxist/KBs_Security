Testing for ECB authentication cookies:

1. Create 2 users with similar names: test1 and test2 and the same password password, then look at the cookie sent back by the application.

2. create 2 users with similar names: test1 and test2 and the same password password, then look at the cookie sent back by the application.


In the pentesterlab example, sending a long string of "a" showed a pattern repeating every 8 bytes. Knowing this, one could create a username with 8 characters and then "admin" afterwards, so for example "aaaaaaaaadmin".

Once authenticated, send the auth cookie again to decoder.  Base64 decode it and you get the encrypted auth cookie again. Delete the first 8 bytes, followed by base64 encoding and you have an admin auth cookie!
