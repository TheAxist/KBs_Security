consider, for example, the following HTML page (let’s say this is the content of http://www.vulnerable.site/welcome.html):

<HTML>
<TITLE>Welcome!</TITLE>
Hi
<SCRIPT>
var pos=document.URL.indexOf("name=")+5;
document.write(document.URL.substring(pos,document.URL.length));
</SCRIPT>
<BR>
Welcome to our system
…
</HTML>
 
Normally, this HTML page would be used for welcoming the user, e.g.:

  http://www.vulnerable.site/welcome.html?name=Joe

However, a request such as:

  http://www.vulnerable.site/welcome.html?name=
  <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

would result in an XSS condition. Let’s see why: the victim’s browser receives this link, sends an HTTP request to www.vulnerable.site, and receives the above (static!) HTML page. The victim’s browser then starts parsing this HTML into DOM. The DOM contains an object called document, which contains a property called URL, and this property is populated with the URL of the current page, as part of DOM creation. When the parser arrives to the Javascript code, it executes it and it modifies the raw HTML of the page. In this case, the code references document.URL, and so, a part of this string is embedded at parsing time in the HTML, which is then immediately parsed and the Javascript code found (alert(…)) is executed in the context of the same page, hence the XSS condition.
