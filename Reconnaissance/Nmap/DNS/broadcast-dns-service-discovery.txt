nmap --script=broadcast-dns-service-discovery 

Attempts to discover hosts' services using the DNS Service Discovery protocol. It sends a multicast DNS-SD query and collects all the responses.

The script first sends a query for _services._dns-sd._udp.local to get a list of services. It then sends a followup query for each one to try to get more information.
