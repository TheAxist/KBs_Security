SSH Relays
==========
ssh -D 8123 -f -C -q -N axis@exampleIP
Explanation of arguments

-D: Tells SSH that we want a SOCKS tunnel on the specified port number (you can choose a number between 1025-65536)
-f: Forks the process to the background
-C: Compresses the data before sending it
-q: Uses quiet mode
-N: Tells SSH that no command will be sent once the tunnel is up


Verify that the tunnel is up and running with this command:
ps aux | grep ssh
