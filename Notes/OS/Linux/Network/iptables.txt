IPTABLES
Note that Rules are applied in order of appearance, and the inspection ends immediately when there is a match.

All commands to be run as root:
iptables
-L	lists
-A      Add rule
-D      Drop rule 

Examples
--------
# Adding Rules: Adds a rule at end of specified chain
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

# Deleting Rules: delete rule in 5th position
iptables -D INPUT 5

# Inserting Rules: create a rule at first position
iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT


# Block Traffic: Specific IP:
iptables -A INPUT -s 98.190.145.152 -j DROP

# Unblock Traffic: Specific IP:
iptables -D INPUT -s 98.190.145.152 -j DROP
