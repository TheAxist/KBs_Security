During a penetration test , once you have compromised a machine on the internal network, the next step generally is to pivot and then scan, fingerprint exploit and compromise other hosts in the same internal network. Sometimes, it might be useful to tunnel all the TCP communications via a meterpreter session, and not just a single port or a group of ports. This can be achieved in Metasploit using the socks proxy auxiliary module, which allows a pen-tester to tunnel TCP traffic generated by external programs like Nessus  and Nmap to be tunneled via the socks proxy, which in-turn forwards the traffic via the meterpreter session , to the internal network that is not directly accessible. 

Auxilary/tcpconnect
msf> route add 192.168.158.0 255.255.255.0 1

The next step is to start the socks proxy form the metasploit and bind it to local loopback adapter on port 1080 (default port):

msf > use auxiliary/server/socks4a
msf auxiliary(socks4a) > set SRVHOST 127.0.0.1
msf auxiliary(socks4a) > set SRVPORT 1080
msf auxiliary(socks4a) > run
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
[*] Starting the socks4a proxy server
