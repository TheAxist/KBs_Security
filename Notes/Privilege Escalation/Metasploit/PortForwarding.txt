Use portfwd in Meterpreter
meterpreter > portfwd add –l 3389 –p 3389 –r  [target host]
meterpreter > portfwd delete –l 3389 –p 3389 –r [target host]
meterpreter > portfwd list


"add" : will add the port forwarding to the list and will essentially create a tunnel for us. Please note, this tunnel will also exist outside the Metasploit console, making it available to any terminal session.
-l 3389 : is the local port that will be listening and forwarded to our target. This can be any port on your machine, as long as it’s not already being used.
-p 3389 : is the destination port on our targeting host.



Background session, Use a Combonation of Port Forwarding and "Pass-the-Hash" Win.exe

> portfwd add -l 445 -p 445 -r 10.7.0.22


Now any traffic will be routed through the meterpreter session
