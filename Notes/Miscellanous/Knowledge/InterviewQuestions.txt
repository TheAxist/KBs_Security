You are trying to footprint a network and decide to conduct a SYN scan; You notice that you never seem to get a response though. What could be a likely cause?


You are in charge of conducting an assessment and need to review the following items:

- SQLi

- XSS

- CSRF

- Services required for operation are the only services allowed through the FW

-- The application contains over 1 million lines of code; the number of pages contain over 1000 web pages; The pages responsible for input total 5 pages

- 2 Login portal pages

- Forum page

- Support page

- Purchasing page

-- You have been allotted 30 hours of effort; To conduct a complete assessment of this size would take easily 40+ hours (including writing a report). You also have to allot time to get the report through your QA. How would you approach this assessment to ensure you remain on time and within budget?


Talk to be about serialization and why it can be a security issue. What might be a way to mitigate


You are dealing with a project where there is a finding that a login page is vulnerable to brute force attacks. How would you approach mitigation and what options would you present to the project team?


You are testing a web application and need to determine if the password is properly secured in the database. This is a black box test and the team has been instructed not to divulge the answer through communication or code review. How could you determine if a password is encrypted versus stored in plain text? How could you determine if the password is hashed versus either of the previous?
