DIRB - Web Content Scanner
---------------------------

##Usage##
dirb <url_base> [<wordlist_file(s)>] [options]
dirb http://10.0.1.18

##Description##
DIRB is a Web Content Scanner. It looks for existing (and/or hidden) Web Objects. It basically works by launching a dictionary based attack against a web server and analyzing the response.

    DirB - /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/
	
    wfuzz - /usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/
    SecList - /usr/share/seclists

DIRB comes with a set of preconfigured attack wordlists for easy usage but you can use your custom wordlists. Also DIRB sometimes can be used as a classic CGI scanner, but remember is a content scanner not a vulnerability scanner.

DIRB can use multiple wordfiles at a time.  Seperate with coma ","
