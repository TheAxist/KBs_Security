Example:
nmap --script smb-enum-shares.nse -p445 <host>

 Attempts to list shares using the srvsvc.NetShareEnumAll MSRPC function and retrieve more information about them using srvsvc.NetShareGetInfo. If access to those functions is denied, a list of common share names are checked.

Finding open shares is useful to a penetration tester because there may be private files shared, or, if it's writable, it could be a good place to drop a Trojan or to infect a file that's already there. Knowing where the share is could make those kinds of tests more useful, except that determining where the share is requires administrative privileges already.
