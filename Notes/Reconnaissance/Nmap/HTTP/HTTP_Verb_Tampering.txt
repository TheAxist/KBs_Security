NMap: HTTP Verb Tampering
-------------------------

Example useage:
nmap -sV --script http-method-tamper <target>

nmap -p80 --script http-method-tamper --script-args 'http-method-tamper.paths={/cgi-bin/,/tmp/,/angel/,/psecret/}' 10.0.2.19 -vv

Attempts to bypass password protected resources (HTTP 401 status) by performing HTTP verb tampering. If an array of paths to check is not set, it will crawl the web server and perform the check against any password protected resource that it finds.

The script determines if the protected URI is vulnerable by performing HTTP verb tampering and monitoring the status codes. First, it uses a HEAD request, then a POST request and finally a random generated string ( This last one is useful when web servers treat unknown request methods as a GET request. This is the case for PHP servers ).
