Python Interpreter:

Use the & operator to combine two or more commands on windows, for unix use the ; operator. If you need your command to be a string with no empty spaces, you could replace all space characters with their hex value ( \x20 ), so the dir command would be: 127.0.0.1\x20&\x20dir 




Note that this method works only with the python interperter. An alternative that works well with python's os.popen and on windows termilal would be to use a comma between your parameters and remove all spaces between the commands, eg: 127.0.0.1&dir,c:\users
