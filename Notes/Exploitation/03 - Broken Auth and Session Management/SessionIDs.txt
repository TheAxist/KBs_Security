Session IDs:
------------
If a session ID is the same with a user account everytime it log in and out, this should be considered a red flag.  If the session ID is ever compromised, it means the account can be owned for the eternity of the accounts exsistence.

- Create 2-4 unique user accounts and study the session IDs generated to see what the diffeernces are.  - If it increments by 1, thats bad. If only a small part changes, thats not random enough which is bad and potentially brute forcable. 
- Run the session IDs through "hashid" to determine the hash its using
- You could save the hashes to a file and try cracking/brute forcing them with john or hashcat.
- Think customized wordlists
