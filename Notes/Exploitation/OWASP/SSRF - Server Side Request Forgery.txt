Server Side Request Forgery:
============================
SSRF can exsist in URL parameters, Host or Referer headers:

The following example will flag in Burp Scanner as a "External service interaction (DNS)":

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: hvg6bx6zpwmssjh40fss1pstrkxal2nqdd31s.burpcollaborator.net
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform
Connection: close

At this point, you'll want to try switching out the Host header, and identify how it behaves. Can you get other content to return to the screen? What happens when you query a server you know thats there? What about a server you know that isnt there?


Similar to a file include. Maniuplate the URL:
